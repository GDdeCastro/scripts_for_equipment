# scripts_for_equipment
In this repository, I will add scripts that were written to control laboratory equipment such as lock-in amplifiers (lakeshore 7265) and temperature controllers. They were used in the Laboratory for Quantum Matter under Extreme Conditions, IFUSP.

In this file, I will add a short description for each script to explain their objective.
